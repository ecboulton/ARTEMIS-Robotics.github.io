      <h1>Sponsorship</h1>
      <h2>Abbotsleigh</h2>
      <img src="/images/abb_logo.png" class="sponsor"><p class="sponsor">As our biggest sponsor, Abbotsleigh (our school) provides us with financial funding for our team by setting a fixed amount of money as part of the activities fees because we are an extracurricular activity but also the fees for tournament entry. Abbotsleigh also supplies us with equipment, the use of the well-equipped DT workshops and access to storage space for our robot and tools. Finally, our teachers encourage and support us as mentors.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Argosy Foundation</h2>
      <img src="/images/argosy.jpg" class="sponsor"><p class="sponsor">In 2016, we were fortunate to receive a FIRST® Rookie Grant from Argosy Foundation. This provides us with funding for the first two years of our team, and has been helpful in getting us off to a good start. At the end of our rookie year, we wrote an essay detailing our progress and what we’ve learnt in the past year which ensured our sponsorship for our second year. After we won the Rookie All Stars award in 2016 and went to St Louis, we were invited to an Argosy Foundation party and were able to meet with the head of Argosy Foundation and foster new relationships with the other rookie teams that were there. The Argosy Foundation continued to sponsor us throughout our second year as a continuation of the Rookie Grant that we received in our first year.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Sell and Parker Metal Recycling Services</h2>
      <img src="/images/sellparker.jpg" class="sponsor"><p class="sponsor">Sell and Parker provides us with scrap metal which we are able to specify the type and size of. This give us the resources with which we can prototype and build our robot. We became partners with them as a parent of Abbotsleigh is a manager with the company. This partnership has helped us address sustainability and we are grateful to be able to use scrap metal rather than buying all new materials for our robot. Some of our mentors also visited their site to check out their operations.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Ford</h2>
      <img src="/images/ford.jpg" class="sponsor"><p class="sponsor">Ford provided us with sponsorship after the Ford Fuels Innovation event was hosted by our team in 2015. We showcased LEGO Robots, the Cougars’ FTC and 3132’s FRC robot from the 2015 game which students could drive and gain an understanding about the opportunities available to them through robotics. Through this event we were able to share different FIRST programs with local schools, as well as many students in our own school who hadn’t heard about what we do.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Treotham Automation</h2>
      <img src="/images/treotham.jpg" class="sponsor"><p class="sponsor">Treotham have joined us this year as a sponsor through generous donation of parts to the team. Our 2018 robot required linear slides, and upon sending them our CAD, Treotham was happy to help, giving us 4 w-profile igus linear slides with carriages, and a long section of energy chain to help wire our lift. These parts are proudly on our robot, and we have written a piece for their newsletter to express our gratitude and explain how we put their products to good use.</p>
      <br>
      <h2>Telstra Foundation</h2>
      <img src="/images/telstra.jpg" class="sponsor"><p class="sponsor">The Telstra Foundation generously helped fund  our team with a community grant in our rookie year. As our first sponsors, we are incredibly grateful for their help in launching our FIRST journey.</p>
