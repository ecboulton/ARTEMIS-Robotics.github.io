      <h1>Safety</h1>
      <div class="redbanner">
        <p>ARTEMIS actively encourages and promotes safety, understanding its importance to all areas of robotics.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Training</h2>
        <p>At the beginning of each year, all members need to complete the OnGuard Online Training. This test contains various categories which all need to be passed in order to use the corresponding tools and machines. These categories include: an introduction to workshop PPE, woodworking hand tools, metalworking hand tools, general machine safety, electronics safety, power tools safety, battery, using scroll saws and electrical drills, pedestal drills, and staple guns.</p>
        <p>Workshop inductions are conducted at the beginning of each year and throughout the year as new members join. This enforces safety as everyone must know what machines they are allowed to use, where the emergency stop buttons are located, and what safety considerations are required in the lab.</p>
      <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <p>Safety glasses are required at all times to keep eyes protected. We make it fun to have our own glasses by allowing decorations that do not interfere with vision. This also helps to differentiate each pair of glasses.</p>
        <p>Hair should also be tied back if long enough to get caught in any tools, and put in a bun if very long. Team hair ties encourage everyone to remember this.</p>
        <p>Mentor supervision and permission is required when using any tool. Experienced students may supervise use with mentor permission, as long as mentor is still in the lab.</p>
        <p>Workshop setup encourages safety. In the Design and Technology labs, each machine is tagged with information about what age a student must be to use it. Taped lines on the floor are an indication of areas one should stand while others are operating machinery. The stop buttons are prominent, as is the First Aid Kit.</p>
      <h2>At Competitions</h2>
        <p>Each team member must pass a safety quiz before the competition so that they know the specific requirements of tournaments and being in a new environment. We also have many procedures and backup plans:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A spill kit is an important safety item at tournaments. All team members know that if there is a battery problem, they need to get the protective gloves and grab the bucket with the kit - dust pan & bi-carb soda. As many International teams might not have a spill kit ready, every year we have spare spill kits that we give to international and/or rookie teams.</li>
            <li>The buddy system is put in place when venturing out of mentor supervision at competition. Students must travel with a buddy in case of any incidents.</li>
            <li>A safety captain has been nominated to remind team members of safe practice throughout the competition. The captain has exemplified safe practice through the season.</li>
            <li>In the case where we have family and friends visiting, we have spare glasses for them to wear.</li>
          </ul>
