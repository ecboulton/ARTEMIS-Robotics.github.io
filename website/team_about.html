      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>ARTEMIS is an Australian all-girls team from Abbotsleigh Senior School in Sydney which sees the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) as the kiln that forges our future in areas far greater than just robotics. As a team, ARTEMIS sees FRC through the life changing opportunities and memories we share; our experiences shaping us like clay on a potter’s wheel, preparing us as vessels to carry the legacy of FIRST. In this way we create a fairer world, becoming carriers of STEM in our community.</p>
      <div class="redbanner">
        <p>Our mission statement is “STEM for a fairer world” and we try to embody this in everything we set out to do.</p>
      </div>
      <p>ARTEMIS is an acronym for ‘Abbotsleigh Robotics Team: Engineering, Mathematics, Inspiration and Science’. Our name was inspired by Artemis, the Greek goddess of hunting and wildlife, who is reflected in the arrows in our team logo.</p>
      <img src="/images/squad.jpg" alt="The Artemis Team">
      <p>Within ARTEMIS, there is both active FLL and FRC teams. As the FRC team, we help the FLL teams by mentoring them. LEGO® provides the optimum building blocks for FRC as it is easily accessible and has helped us develop a deep interest in robotics and STEM. FLL initialises a bond between robotics and life skills like problem solving and creative thinking.</p>
      <p>Through FRC, we can continue to develop these skills in a comfortable and friendly environment. We currently have 4 FLL teams running in years 7 and 8, the majority of whom will go on to join the FRC team. We promote this progression by running an FTC team in the off-season, allowing potential FRC students in year 8 to get a taste of FRC build practices and team members through competing in the FTC competition.</p>
