      <h1>Volunteering</h2>
      <p>ARTEMIS volunteers to give back to the community. We volunteer not only at FIRST® events but also in our Abbotsleigh Junior School. As a team we have volunteered over 2210 hours at different FIRST®  events, ranging from FLL and FTC to Asia-Pacific Invitationals (API) and FRC regionals. This helps support FIRST®  and spreads the message of STEM to our wider community.</p>
      <h2>FLL, FTC and FRC regional/nationals</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/fllvolunteering.png">
        <p class="left">Volunteering at the regional and national competitions at Macquarie University means that we can not only support our own Abbotsleigh FLL team, but see the progression of FIRST®. By assisting with judge check in, queuing, field resetting, judging, emceeing and DJ-ing we were able to ensure that all teams were happy and ready to compete to the best of their ability. The FRC program is often short on Volunteers in Australia, due to the lower number of teams at the events. Our volunteer efforts in this program mean that we have at times made between  ¼ sand ½ of the volunteers present at the events. “ARTEMIS has had a huge impact on the FIRST progression in Australia. They are some of our most dedicated volunteers, doing everything from the high profile jobs to the work that no one gets excited about. Regardless of what they are asked to do, they do it with energy, enthusiasm and passion. Without their many hours of volunteering, FIRST Australia would not have been able to handle the massive growth in FLL or FTC. Watching their team interact with students of all ages at the Australian FLL, FTC and FRC events, it is clear that they are great role models and are inspiring the next generation” says Luan Heimlich, Regional director of FIRST in Australia.</p>

      <h2>Wahroonga FLL Regional</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/regionals.jpg">
        <p class="right">In 2018, our FLL and FRC teams had the opportunity to volunteer at the regional that was hosted by ARTEMIS. The FLL girls acted as runners, while the older FRC girls worked as judges and referees. This was a great opportunity for the new FLL girls to learn what happens behind the scenes at a regional competition, but also interact with many other teams as well as their soon to be teammates in FRC.</p>

      <h2>API</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/api volunteers.jpg">
        <p class="left">During the July period, the Asia-Pacific Invitational events for the FLL (and previously FTC) games are usually held for teams in the Asia-Pacific region. When these invitational events are run, there is usually a need for  volunteers to help out. ARTEMIS has been one of the teams that has students volunteering in different roles at these events. Jobs that we assisted with included the field reset, judge check-in, camera operator, emcee and scorekeeper/timer. This event helped some of our members get outside of their comfort zones while interacting with other teams.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>DDU</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/ddu volunteers.jpg">
        <p class="right">Not only does ARTEMIS compete at DDUs, we also volunteer at them in order to ensure the event runs smoothly. Volunteering not only gives to the FIRST community but also provides a sense of responsibility and alternative way to connect with FIRST. To our team, this is also a way for ex-ARTEMIS members to still appreciate and contribute to its innovation, spirit and creativity. FIRST does not cease in their appreciation of the volunteers which makes every minute more worthwhile.</p>

      <h2>Abbotsleigh Junior School</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/juniorschool.jpg">
        <p class="left">ARTEMIS collaborates with the Abbotsleigh Junior School Lego® Robotics team and volunteers to mentor them. In conjunction with their makerspace, we help the younger students the primary foundations of engineering and design. We were also able to help develop their coding and programming skills using the NXT Lego® Mindstorms robots. Some of the girls that were previously in this club have been inspired by ARTEMIS members to join the team when they entered the Senior School and are encouraged to continue the FIRST progression. </p>
