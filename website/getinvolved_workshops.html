      <h1>Project Athena Workshops</h2>
      <p>Our Athena Workshops provide an opportunity for all of the members of the team to share our knowledge to other teams and the wider community as it is shared on YouTube and will be easily accessible to everyone. Our workshops cover the basic concepts of robotics as listed below. The first year students and mentors on ARTEMIS gave the workshops, working on our own presentation and communication skills. However in 2017 we gathered experts to share their skills and experience as a part of the project. Some of the workshops that were completed are detailed below in addition to 3D printing, Chairman's, electrical systems, engineering drawings, FLL, laser cutting, mechanical design, public speaking, software, computer vision and time management.</p>
      <h2>Prototyping</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/callisto.jpg">
        <p class="left"><a href="https://au.linkedin.com/in/kernalsanders">Aaron Sanders</a> presented a prototyping workshop, teaching students to evaluate performance with cost in a final product, with unlimited prototyping resources. Through a small team activity, we learnt the balance between the goals of our objective - to build a tall tower - and the cost and funds we needed to reach the final product. He gave us some very useful points to remember, such as making sure you have a clear objective to your prototype, and when testing, ensure that you are only testing one variable at a time. These lessons have carried over to our prototyping this season, and will continue to be a part of how our team operates.</p>

      <h2>Computer Vision</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/drone.jpg">
        <p class="right">Jaci Brunning presented a computer vision workshop via skype. This was attended in Sydney by members of teams 3132 Thunder Down under and 4613 Barker Redbacks as well as our own team. The instructive presentation started from a foundation for people who were not exposed to software, to the intricate details and comparisons to what computer vision can achieve. The specific steps provided and advice about when to start working on systems and when and how to implement them, has inspired our team to develop computer vision systems for future years.</p>

      <h2>Mechanical Tools</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/mechanical.png">
        <p class="left">The Mechanical tips and tools workshop covered aspects of safety, reducing errors, pragmatic advice for building robots, organisation, as well as detailed descriptions of how to safely use mechanical tools. The purpose of this presentation was to give others an overall understanding of the different aspects that the mechanical sub-team has to keep in mind. Further on, there was a practical activity, where the audience was split into various groups told to design, make and test a structure for a ball run with a ping-pong ball. Within the criteria, groups had to choose from certain materials, and use a variety of tools. The group that had the ball running for the longest was crowned the winner. This activity allowed everyone to try to implement tool use into the design in a safe environment, strengthening the mechanical skills of the team.</p>

      <h2>Video Editing</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/sinclair.jpg">
        <p class="right">The video editing workshop gave insight into making professional videos. There was a hands-on tutorial teaching each audience member how to put together a simple video using a range of features on the program Premiere Pro. The presenters also outlined how videos can be used as an effective marketing strategy and a widespread resource to share our team’s progress. The professionalism and consistency of our videos comes as an asset to the team and has engaged sponsors, parents and future students of the team. We ran another Video editing workshop in 2017 to expand on what we had previously learned. Jake Sinclair, an FRC alumni who helped make more than 5 winning Chairman’s videos for FRC team 3132, ran the workshop. He gave us a number of useful FRC specific and general tips, that many members have used to improve their capturing of video, and editing in general.</p>
