      <h1>Collaboration</h1>
      <h2>FRC Team 4613 - Barker Redbacks</h2>
        <div class="div_leftalign">
          <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/barker.jpg">
            <p class="left">The Barker Redbacks team has a close relationship with ARTEMIS. Since the foundation of ARTEMIS in 2015, Barker has put up their hand in welcoming us to the FIRST® community and have made exceptional efforts in sharing their expertise. Barker students and mentors have been extremely generous in offering advice, encouragement and support throughout our robotics journey. At the beginning of build season 2015-2016, their team invited ARTEMIS students to get together and go over the rules of the game, and brainstorm different build strategies. We thought about how the game would run, and how teams could collaborate to gain maximum points. We were also given advice on how to make a good rookie robot including what equipment and materials we might want to use.In addition to helping ARTEMIS, the Barker Redbacks host a scrimmage where they invite various other teams to test their robots before bagging and tagging before the end of build season. This allowed us to practice on a fully-functioning half-field, providing invaluable driver experience.</p>

      <h2>FRC Team 3478 - Lambots</h2>
        <div class="div_rightalign">
          <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/mexico.jpg">
            <p class="right">Collaborating with the Lambots team from Mexico was very helpful as they provided us with lots of suggestions and advice during our rookie year. During build season 2016, we were able to skype the Lambots and ask them questions about many things including what to pay attention to on the field, what judges are looking for, tips on placement of motors, and how to make our pit display interactive. In addition, we were also able to exchange cultural concepts and discuss team costuming and uniforms for competitions. Speaking to the Lambots was a great opportunity to know how their team has progressed. The Lambots had won the Rookie All Stars award previously, so we took the insightful tips openly and were able to implement them throughout the season. Further on, we were able to meet up with the Lambots at Championships in St Louis, and we hope to continue this relationship with them in the future.</p>

      <h2>FRC Team 6836 - Tinkerers</h2>
        <div class="div_leftalign">
          <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/tinkerers.png">
            <p class="left">Our relationship with the Tinkerers started because one of our mentors, Fred, became a mentor on their team as well. We have attended their meetings, providing mentoring and software help. We have also enjoyed social events with them, including a beach party during build season, where we enjoyed the ocean, then built up EV3 robots to battle each other for fun. As this was their rookie year, we leant the team parts when they needed them, and provided the use of our lasercutter when they needed sponsor signs for their first off-season event.</p>

      <h2>FRC Team 6770 - Semia United</h2>
        <div class="div_rightalign">
          <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/semiaunited.png">
            <p class="right">During the 2017 Sydney Regionals, we ‘cheesecaked’ with Chinese team Semia United, installing our spare climber to their robot after gathering that their climbing mechanism wasn’t functioning. This improved their robot’s point scoring abilities tremendously, and the experience inspired us to work harder to provide technical help to other teams. </p>

      <h2>Start of Season Strategy Meetings</h2>
        <div class="div_leftalign">
          <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/strategy.jpg">
            <p class="left">In 2017 and 2019, our team has hosted start of season strategy meetings at the beginning of build season. These are open-invitation events to teams in the local area where we watch the game animation and discuss rules and strategies. Teams who have previously attended these events include 6510 (Pymble Pride), 4729 (EMUs), 6061 (Carbon Crusaders), 7074 (Reapers), 7838 (North Sydney High Schools) and mentors from St Cathodes.</p>
