      <h1>Outreach in the School Community</h1>
      <h2>Science Week</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/science week junior.png">
        <p class="left">ARTEMIS took the opportunity to teach the students and staff of Abbotsleigh about what our robotics team does, and to raise awareness about STEM during Science week. We set up our robot and had activities that catered for different age groups within the school community. Through our activities, we were able to build the understanding of the students and staff about components of our team. One of the activities included matching tools to their name and uses, which many of the girls were interested in. The school community was encouraged to ask any questions they had about our robot. Science week was all about raising awareness about STEM and our robotics team, opposed to learning about content, and specifics about how to build a robot.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Assembly Presentations</h2>
        <p>We use Assembly presentations as one of the most convenient and effective means of connecting with the school community. Aimed at promoting robotics to both students and teachers, we are able to give short speeches and presentations to share our interests in STEM and particularly robotics. We also use this time to promote events, tournaments, projects and our results to the school community. After build season, we are able to display our robot and show others what we have accomplished in only 6 weeks.</p>
      <h2>Ruth Sanger Night</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/ruthsanger.png">
        <p class="right">Ruth Sanger night is award presentation night celebrating Abbotsleigh students’ achievements in Science and Mathematics. Ruth Sanger was a famous Australian scientist and doctor who was educated at Abbotsleigh. Some members of ARTEMIS were able to give a presentation during this evening promoting robotics to the school community in 2016. We gave a brief description of build season, and also showed a video summary. By doing this, we broadened the amount of families interested in STEM and inspired them to pursue more science and technology based activities. This presentation was particularly effective as it was catered towards people that like STEM subjects and that are good at them.</p>

      <h2>Staff Development Day</h2>
        <p>ARTEMIS was given the opportunity to run a workshop for teachers from a variety of faculties for a Professional Development day at Abbotsleigh. The teachers were given a crash course in how to use EV3’s and then asked to program and build their robot for a short performance. The English Staff members programmed their robot to execute stage choreography for a monologue from Othello, Junior School Teachers made theirs dance to “Shake it Off” and the language teachers had theirs dance to the J-pop band AKB48. The teachers came away from the day with a new perspective on how they could integrate the use of robotics into their variety of subjects.</p>
      <h2>GLOW Festival</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/glow.png">
        <p class="left">The GLOW festival is an annual festival held at Abbotsleigh, mimicking Sydney’s VIVID Festival of Light. It showcases different projects created by the students of Abbotsleigh, and many stalls are hosted by clubs within the school. ARTEMIS held a robot demonstration and allowed various visitors to have turns driving the robot, while simultaneously charging a small price and providing the team with some additional income. Our 2018 robot, Fawkes, is our largest robot and featured a lifting mechanism that could reach to roughly two meters high. The size of the robot and the prospect of controlling it provided our stall with a steady flow of traffic. To assist with the theme of light, on the sides of our robot, we decorated Fawkes with colour changing LED lights.</p>

      <h2>Steam Pockets</h2>
        <p>Our school has a reward system in which those who dedicate their time to certain areas of extracurricular activities receive embroidered bands on their blazer, dubbed “pockets”. Originally, the areas were Dramatic Arts, Language Arts, Sport and Music, but as of 2017, a fifth pocket was added for STEAM. This pocket was added because of the support the idea received from the robotics students, as well as staff that are involved with our team. In our FRC team, most students who aren't in their first year have at least the lowest level STEAM pocket. The first ever STEAM pockets were all awarded to girls who were a part of the robotics team, and most Abbotsleigh students who hold STEAM pockets are or have been ARTEMIS members, as participating in robotics earns a lot of credit towards gaining a STEAM pocket.</p>
      <h2>Tedx Event</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/tedx.png">
        <p class="right">At our School’s inaugural Tedx event, ARTEMIS hosted a display to showcase our 2018 robot, Fawkes. We gained exposure to students in our school but also to local schools who were invited to various talks. Under the theme ‘Dare’ we challenged students to drive the robot and launch Power Cubes using the roughly two metres lifting mechanism.</p>
