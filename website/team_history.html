      <h1>Team History</h1>
      <img src="/images/originalsquad.jpg">
      <p>ARTEMIS (Team 5876) was founded in April 2015 by Mrs Susan Filan in the wake of the inaugural Australian FRC regional. Alongside Mrs Filan were Erin Filan, Penelope Blake and Fred Westling from Macquarie University teams 3132 and 5331, who also assisted in starting up the team.</p>
      <p>The team originally began as a group of 14 girls in Years 9 and 10 (see photo above). Throughout 2015, we successfully raised the profile of robotics at school through assemblies and outreach events. Over the years, many more students have joined as the program has gained popularity, and students have moved up through the FLL program. In addition, we are fortunate to have a group of dedicated mentors who are from various industries to guide us through the different components of robotics.</p>
      <p>ARTEMIS is a team that carries our stories through our community, connecting the experiences of an unlikely range of people through robotics. Our passion to use STEM for a fairer world fills us with a desire to support FIRST programs and students, to share our experiences with our sponsors, and promote FIRST in our communities. We strive to not only store our inspiration but to share it, both locally and internationally, pouring out our knowledge to create and sustain the fair and innovative world we aim to live in.</p>
