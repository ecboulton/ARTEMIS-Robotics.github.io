      <h1>Impacts</h1>
      <div class="redbanner">
        <p>Within our school community, ARTEMIS has shaped the lives of many students, carrying the message of STEM to more than 1300 girls and 80 teachers.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Student Interest in STEM</h2>
      <p>After experiencing FIRST® for just one year, there has been an increase in students interested in STEM subjects. After many years, Abbotsleigh will be running a Software Development and Design class for year 11 students. Previously, there had not been enough students interested in taking this subject for the HSC, however in 2017 after a growing interest in STEM through the school and robotics, students will be able to further their knowledge through this program. Of the students currently in year 11, a high percentage are currently studying physics and chemistry amongst other sciences. Across the team, there is an increasing interest in STEM and the ability to stretch it further from robotics is prominent. Workshops conducted by numerous universities and companies have been attended by ARTEMIS students. The interest in STEM sparked by participating in FIRST® have opened many pathways for students.</p>
      <h2>Observation by Others</h2>
      <p>Others outside the ARTEMIS community have commented on the positive impacts of robotics for the students. This comes from a range of staff from different departments across the school. English teachers have noticed more confidence in public speaking, mathematics teachers have commented upon improvement in problem solving and many others have observed how wonderful it is to see members happy and proud of their team.</p>
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>The following are responses from FRC students, mentors and teachers, explaining the impacts of robotics on their development.</p>
      <h3>Why did you decide to join robotics?</h3>
      <p class="quote">At first, I decided to join robotics after the ‘Ford Fuels Innovation’ event after looking at the robots on display as I thought it was really cool and awesome as it was students who had built it. I thought ‘Imagine if I could do that!’. Coincidentally, at the same time we had just handed in our electives for year 9 and I was very stressed that I’d do badly in IST, so I thought that joining would be beneficial towards that. However, when I came to the first meeting, it was much more than school classes, it wasn’t just another co-curricular activity – it was something I had a passion for, something I enjoyed, wanted and needed to do.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Nine Student</p>
      <p class="quote">I decided to join robotics after [Mrs Filan] came to visit my IST class last year because it was something different and seemed really fun I was also interested in science and technology and also liked doing hands on activities. I wasn’t really prepared for all the excitement that was to follow!</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Ten Student</p>
      <p class="quote">I have always had a strong interest in robotics since I was a teenager. I studied electrical engineering with my final year major in robotic control. Since graduation, I had little opportunity of working in the robotic field, but this strong interest is still with me after all these years!!! I was so pleased to attend the robotics exhibiting held at Abbotsleigh Senior School in August 2015, and had the opportunity of talking to [Mrs Filan] about robotics. I am very grateful for the opportunity to get involved with the FRC team. I joined the FRC team to:
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>Offer my design and engineering experience to assist the team</li>
          <li>Assist the team to construct a robot that meets the designed functions</li>
          <li>Have the opportunity to learn more about FRC</li>
          <li>To learn from experienced mentors like [Mrs Filan] and Erin to improve my mentoring skills</li>
          <li>Have fun with working with likeminded people like [Mrs Filan], Erin and the team to create a working robot for the FRC tournament</li>
          <li>To encourage and support young kids to pursue engineering as a career</li>
        </ul>
      </p><p class="attribution">~ Industry Mentor</p>
    <h3>What did you hope to learn or experience?</h3>
      <p class="quote">I was hoping to learn more about STEM and I thought that it might be able to help me with IST. I was also hoping to learn how to problem solve and go through the design process with having a bit of fun. I actually enjoyed it – it was very different to DT, and it was nice to do it with my friends. I was hoping to experience the true meaning of teamwork, to have really close friends that were necessarily people who I thought I could be friends with. I also actually became really close friends with the people in my year which was a wonderful benefit.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Nine Student</p>
      <p class="quote">At the beginning of robotics, I just wanted to know more about robotics and how things worked, but after our first build season, I’m looking at going into engineering or science technology fields. FRC has given me an opportunity to get a grasp of the process of designing and developing a robot that can complete a task I have learnt how to set and complete goals within a time frame.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Ten Student</p>
      <p class="quote">
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>Learn to improve my mentoring skills by meeting other mentors</li>
          <li>Learn to inspire young kids to develop a strong interest in engineering and science</li>
          <li>Experience the FRC tournament – it is truly an awesome experience!!!</li>
        </ul></p><p class="attribution">~ Industry Mentor</p>
      <p class="quote">Just the experience of working with the girls in a small co-curricular environment, and hopefully the transfer of some problem-solving skills!</p><p class="attribution">~ Teacher Mentor</p>
    <h3>What has surprised you about robotics and/or competition?</h3>
      <p class="quote">I joined the team in its starting stage, and watched it grow into a larger team. As the weeks progressed, I learnt that robotics wasn’t just about building and driving robots, it was a motley of different things, from managing sponsors and making business plans - to interact acting and building relationships with other teams - to promoting the team to our school and general community. I was also surprised to discover the amount of planning and thought it took to build one robot! We gave ourselves deadlines for constructions, set ourselves weekly goals and kept our robot simple to achieve the aims we wanted. I leant how to prototype and improvise, and how to breakdown a seemingly huge task into simple, achievable goals. During the competition, it surprised me to discover a new aspect of myself, As I’m generally not an outgoing person, I’ve always found talking to people I don’t know as a daunting prospect. But because of the requirements of the team during the competition, I made a conscientious effort to interact with people from other teams, and make new friends. I learnt that I really enjoyed interacting with other people, and although there were some awkward times, the information that I gather from other teams really assisted out team’s strategy and planning.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Nine Student</p>
      <p class="quote">Probably the most surprising thing was the whole ‘gracious professionalism’ idea, because in normal sporting events you try to do your best, and you hope that the other team is at its best, but if they have unforeseen bad luck, you kind of just shrug it off as bad luck. But in FIRST® the attitude is that if the other teams has unforeseen bad luck, you do your best to help them get over that ‘bad luck’ so they can still be on the top of their game.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Ten Student</p>
      <p class="quote">The impact it has had on me is way bigger than I had expected! I now realise how much us girls can really do. I was surprised by how the complexity of the robot’s design didn’t segregate teams, but made them collaborate together in wanting to help each other rather than just be competitors at a game. </p><p class="attribution">~ Year Eleven Student</p>
      <p class="quote">Amazing organisation of the competition and genuine desire to support young people as they develop many and varied skills not only building a robot but building relationships, problem-solving, teamwork, PR, etc. Talking to one of the judges, she said the judges have to be positive and encouraging with all teams – I like that – it is about valuing people and giving them opportunities to grow and develop. I was also really impressed by the people who willingly donate their time.</p><p class="attribution">~ Teacher Mentor</p>
    <h3>Why should others join ARTEMIS?</h3>
      <p class="quote">ARTEMIS is a chance to prove to the world that STEM isn’t only a boy’s only world. Girls can also get in this field and learn more about science and engineering. You get to see things through, from the beginning as an embryonic idea, to the final end product, a fully functioning robot. Robotics is suitable for all ages, all interests and this team with its mentors and motivated teachers is absolutely incredible. Robotics has so many roles – medial, video editing, programming, constructing and everyone has a role, and there are so many competitions. I have finally found something I can devote my time to. Why not? ARTEMIS is not just a team, it’s a family. They go through highs and lows and they support you even when you don’t know who to turn to. The opportunity is amazing, just being able to experience this is just a blessing. You laugh, you cry, you scream, you hug, you smile, and this is just finding true happiness. You find your passion and it comes with so many benefits, it’s not even a question as to why.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Nine Student</p>
      <p class="quote">Participating in FIRST® is life changing, even though it was our first year, we already had the chance to compete in the championships in St Louis. ARTEMIS is like a family and meeting new people in the team is a rewarding thing. In ARTEMIS, you can apply your STEM skills into the robot and learn something every meeting. Others should join ARTEMIS because –
        <ol class="quote">
          <li>The things we do are enjoyable and there is a lot of team spirit in it.</li>
          <li>We learn lots of new skills which will be useful in the future due to the growing interest in the fields of STEM. Especially for women in science and engineering. Joining ARTEMIS would develop skills that can help aspiring students get into that field, as well as develop their own interest in that field. Even management skills are developed (ie. Business plans, community outreach, funding) as well as media skills (ie. Social media, sponsor letters).</li>
          <li>The whole team is a friendly group, the atmosphere isn’t that stressful, and everyone is out there to support and help each other.</li>
          <li>Being in a FIRST® robotics team puts you in line for lots of different scholarships and opportunities within Australian and overseas</li>
          <li>It would probably look good on your resume/CV</li>
        </ol></p><p class="attribution">~ Year Ten Student</p>
      <p class="quote">Everyone should join ARTEMIS because it truly isn’t all about robots, it is so much more!! I’ve learnt many things that aren’t related such as public speaking skills, problem solving etc. which has helped enhance other subjects I am doing at school rather than something which is entirely different to my education. Also by joining ARTEMIS you get to know the mentors and they in turn help you out so much in widening your knowledge of possible career paths and unique opportunities can become available to you.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Eleven Student</p>
      <p class="quote">
        <ul class="quote">
          <li>ARTEMIS is a great team with dedicated teachers, mentors and members who are passionate about robotics</li>
          <li>ARTEMIS has and extensive experience in robotics design and construction</li>
          <li>ARTEMIS is a great and fun team to work with</li>
          <li>A supportive environment offered by the school to encourage the girls to explore and develop interest in STEM subjects</li>
        </ul></p><p class="attribution">~ Industry Mentor</p>
      <p class="quote">Build relationships with girls you never knew before, but are a lot like you. Learn more about building robots that work, learn more about yourself and find skills you never knew you had.</p><p class="attribution">~ Teacher Mentor</p>
    <h3>Has the experience changed you or your goals in any way?</h3>
      <p class="quote">The experience has transformed my views on STEM, at first my sister said ‘Why? It’s for nerds, it’s weird.’ But honestly, I am weird and a nerd in a wonderful way. It has definitely influenced me to consider following a STEM career and is definitely one of the front runners. It’s kind of weird but sometimes I even dream about robots while I sleep because I think about it a lot! My goals have definitely been changed to build more robots and to mentor a team one day. Due to ARTEMIS and my experience at the FIRST® competition. I’ve become more confident with my interactions with others. I’m doing something I didn’t know I could do, which was interacting with total strangers. The competition was a real eye-opener, and it helped me realise that I can do a lot more than I thought I could. Now, I have also become more interested in the engineering side of medicine, while previously, my long term goal was to become a practitioner of medicine, instead of medical development.</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Nine Student</p>
      <p class="quote">Robotics has inspired me to look into the different engineering and science fields. I have been to some UNSW engineering camps which have helped me look at different types of engineering. Before this, I didn’t really know what engineering involved, but robotics has given me a good idea. Robotics has made me a more proactive person especially when talking to other people. It has changed my goals by making more clear to me what I want to do in my future after school. This experience has changed some of my goals, because before being part of ARTEMIS, I was only interested in robotics and engineering as a passing interest/hobby, but now I really want to improve my skills, especially in programming, because I want to be better at it and these skills might be really helpful in my future (possibly also because I’m interested in game development, as well as archaeology).</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Ten Student</p>
      <p class="quote">Before, I thought what can we do? We’re just a bunch of schoolgirls who have no knowledge in robotics. I mean, I haven’t learnt how to do much yet. All I know is making the physical structure. Nothing about wiring, programming, all those complicated things. Now I say, maybe if we dedicate more time to ARTEMIS, we can achieve great things. It takes time to master a lot of things, someone I talked to did it for four years, patience and dedication is really needed. It has made me widen my perceptions on a whole range of things! It has changed my overall outlook on STEM where I used to think you had to be gifted student to be good at such subjects, but you really don’t need to be. All you need is passion which is bound to happen after you experience FIRST®</p><p class="attribution">~ Year Eleven Student</p>
      <p class="quote">This FRC tournament has offered me a wonderful experience of witnessing the positive impact on young people for STEM subjects. Most importantly, this experience has relighted my strong interest in robotics. It is an inspiring experience to watch a young robotics team like ARTEMIS to grow and achieve great recognition. This wonderful experience has inspired me to spend more time to mentor young people and help them develop their interest in engineering fields. In particular, encouraging more girls to consider engineering as a career.</p><p class="attribution">~ Industry Mentor</p>
      <p class="quote">No! It achieved many of them. I’m hooked big time after experiencing the competition! It is the same feeling I get when I coach a team, or go on outdoor education camps.</p><p class="attribution">~ Teacher Mentor</p>
