      <h1>Outreach to the Public</h1>
      <h2>Bandage Bot</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/starlight foundation.jpg">
        <p class="left">ARTEMIS use STEM for a fairer world through using Robotics to share the joy with seriously ill children and young people affected by serious illness. We run Robotics activities using LEGO EV3s, helping the participants with on-brick coding and letting them put together designs of their own choice. With our partnership with the Starlight Foundation, we have visited the Sydney Children’s Hospital 3 times, which has been broadcasted to over 170 children. Through these Express Room Visits, the team has been able to share our love for Robotics with children who would not otherwise have the opportunity to explore their passion for STEM. We also partner with CanTeen, hosting Robotics activities at their Activity afternoon and their Superhero Summer Camp, impacting the lives of almost 25 young people. For both the Starlight Foundation and CanTeen camps, ARTEMIS uses STEM as a productive and fun way to distract participants from a world of seriousness, and give them opportunities to experience joy and normality.</p>

      <h2>Ford Fuels Innovation</h2>
        <p>In 2015, ARTEMIS hosted the Ford Fuels Innovation event at Abbotsleigh. This was run by both FIRST® Australia and Ford. The purpose of this event was to spread STEM to the school and the wider community. Over 400 students from various schools attended the event as well as additional staff and parents from the Abbotsleigh Junior and Senior school. As a result, many Abbotsleigh girls were inspired to join ARTEMIS - this even resulted in new mentors.</p>
        <p>During the day, one of the Ford engineers came to give talks about engineering and how Ford design engineers from Australia and around the world work together to design innovative products which can be seen on a smaller scale on our team. People from FIRST® Australia were able to bring FRC and FTC robots  for visitors to interact with. Ford also displayed their new Mustang, Kuga and Everest vehicles. We were able to give Ford an opportunity to promote their innovations and in addition, they were able to generously fund our team.</p>
      <h2>E-NABLE</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/prosthetic hand.png">
        <p class="right">As a part of learning necessary skills to 3D print parts ARTEMIS has become involved in the E-NABLE Hand Challenge. E-NABLE is a non-profit organisation that aims to create accessible files for low-cost prosthetic hand devices. This is an important mission, because often, prosthetics are expensive, due to the costs of fitting and producing the prosthetic, they are often too expensive for some people, and often need to be refitted 20 times over the course of a lifetime, especially during childhood. The Hand Challenge involves students from the robotics team printing and then assembling a 3D printed prosthetic hand device, which will then go to a child in need of a hand device. These devices, unlike traditional prosthetics, cost $30-50 US, and are made at no cost to the families who need them.</p>

      <h2>Toys ‘n’ Tucker</h2>
        <p>Our team participated in the Toys ‘n’ Tucker initiative, donating hampers to families who wouldn’t otherwise be able to celebrate Christmas. We worked alongside our school’s service project, strengthening our relationship with our school community. Our school’s Service Prefect, Claire said “ARTEMIS has been actively supporting the 2018/19 Service Project, Connect our Community, through their support and participation in the Toys n Tucker initiative. Their willingness to support the initiative has been invaluable.” We donated over two hampers worth of goods and spent an afternoon sorting donations from the school community, packaging them to be distributed at the warehouse. Furthermore, our involvement was also in partnership with Israeli team 2096, where we participated in their Community FIRST project.</p>
      <h2>Robo Camps</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/kidsprogram2.jpg">
        <p class="left">In September 2016, ARTEMIS launched our first Robocamp, which was aimed at K-2 children and to fundraise for our squad.  We taught the kids how to use the block code to program the LEGO® MINDSTORMS® EV3.  They first discovered how to drive forward and in a square using a basic loop function.  As a fun challenge, we hid their wheels so they would build their own out of LEGO® parts. The solutions the children came up with were creative - one pair used gear ratios to move their robot forward.  We also challenged them with a game called ‘Sumo bots’ which used the line detecting function to observe where the outer ring was and to step back and turn away.  The robots were decorated by the kids with “defenses” in order to flip the opponent’s robot.  The children had heaps of fun and helped the team in developing our ‘Robocamp’ program. Recently in the January holidays we introduced a Robocamp that was for year 5-8 while using Arduino kits that were donated by the Emus team from UNSW.   This means that the activities that they do are more advanced. Robocamp also taught the children how to problem solve, basic programming through block code and the importance of STEM.</p>

      <h2>AIS TAS Conferences</h2>
        <p>In 2016 and 2017, ARTEMIS has spoken at TAS teachers conferences hosted by the Association of Independent Schools (AIS). The sessions held talked about robotics and its benefits, such as improving involvement in STEM fields, and engagement in the classroom. Students from ARTEMIS also talked about their experiences as part of a FIRST robotics team, and how it contributed to their own studies in STEM subjects and possible future careers.</p>
      <h2>Sydney Robotics for Coding and STEM Education</h2>
      <div class="div_rightalign">
        <img class="sideimage_right" src="/images/2016squad.jpg">
        <p class="right">In 2016, ARTEMIS was given the opportunity to share our passion for STEM and FIRST with the Sydney Robotics for Coding and STEM Education group. This group was comprised of professionals in STEM fields, as well as people with an interest of spreading STEM. Alongside Barker mentor Lael Grant, ARTEMIS gave a presentation about what FRC is and why FIRST Programs are great methods for gaining interest and teaching coding and STEM. The group then had the chance to see our workshop and robot and ask the students questions about the build process and what they’ve learned through FRC. Several members expressed interest in starting FLL teams and were fascinated by the opportunities FIRST brings to students.</p>

      <h2>Facebook and Instagram</h2>
        <p>We use Facebook and Instagram to upload pictures and videos that show our the progress our team has made during build season and any news on our team throughout the year to the outer community. ARTEMIS also uses Facebook and Instagram to connect and communicate with other teams globally such as the Lambots and the E-hawks. We are also able to utilise the Facebook platform to livestream our bag-and-tag of the robot each year to share the moment with the community. We currently have 177 followers on Instagram and 320 likes on Facebook.</p>
      <h2>YouTube</h2>
        <p>As part of our social media outreach, we utilise the YouTube platform to upload videos from build season, Chairman's videos and other projects from throughout the year. This allows us to share our build season experiences and tracks our progress throughout the years. We have almost 2500 views on our YouTube videos.</p>
      <h2>Newspaper Coverage</h2>
      <div class="div_leftalign">
        <img class="sideimage_left" src="/images/newspaper 2.png">
        <p class="left">ARTEMIS has appeared in various newspapers including the Daily Telegraph and the Hornsby Advocate. Through this media, we are able to share our love for robotics with the local and wider community, showing them what our team does and our passion for STEM, and our message was received by the 280,000 people who read these newspapers.</p>
