This website is up to date as of April 2019. I definitely need to add newer things that we've done.

HTML and CSS are spaghetti code (this was my first actual web dev project) and I'll get around to fixing them someday. I also didn't know JS at the time so if we want extra functionality, I'm happy to introduce that.

Also, when making the site live (if ever), we need to go through the school so they don't get mad
